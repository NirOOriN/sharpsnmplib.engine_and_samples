\#SNMP Engine and Library Samples
======================

This repository is orginally forked from https://github.com/lextudio/sharpsnmppro-samples.
Sadly but failry the orginal developer decided to remove the SharpSnmpLib.Engine from the release and now is considered as Sample.
This is reasoned by the decision that the original developer won't provide or guarantee any bug fix support on the code base. 

The intention of this repo is to provide a compileable SharpSnmpLib.Engine, with a proper namespace and useful enhancements.
Visual Studio 2017/2019 and .NET Core SDK is required to compile it on Windows.
